JSON : Java Script Object Notation

"Courses":[{"Name":"CSharp", "Duration":"40hrs","Fees":8000},
{"Name":"SQL", "Duration":"20hrs","Fees":5000},....

Similarities between JSON and XML

: Both are hierarchical, human readable, self describing data, can be used by many programming languages, are used to fetch data from the server on request

Differences :
 XML is parsed using XML Parser, where as JSON is parsed using JavaScript function

JSON on parsing gives ready to use javascript objects

JSON does not have inbuilt security and error handling capabilities, unlike XML

Methods used are :

parse() - js object
stringify() - json string
