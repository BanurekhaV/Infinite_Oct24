Layout : We can our own custom layouts (one or more) created and saved inside the Views/Shared Folder
-We can apply any layout to any View by just giving the Layout property a values that points to the path of the layout
@{
 Layout ="<path of the layout file(.cshtml)>"
}
-We can also skip layouts by setting the Layout property to null



Partial Views : are also like regular views, which can be reused multiple times in other views, rather than creating multiple times

Eg : Shipping/Billing address on an ecommerce site
   Comments on Blogging Sites etc..

Calling Partial Views :

1. Html.RenderPartial : It is a void Method that writes the output to the response stream as a part of the same http response
   - It is faster way to render partial views
   - Since it is a void Method, we should enclose the call within '{}'

2. Html.Partial : this method returns a MVC IHtmlString


3. Html.RenderAction : is the best choice when we want to cache the partial view. Can call child action methods and render PartialViews
  - Since it is a void Method, we should enclose the call within '{}'


4. Html.Action : Same as above, but returns a partial view result as IHtmlString.

5. jQuery Load Function : Can display Partial Views on Load method of the Jquery


You may practice for sometime
