Controller : all programming logics are kept here
  - is the main controlling part of MVC
  - It is a mediator between client request and server response
  - Acts like a bridge between view page and models
  - It works with Http request
  - Each browser request is mapped with a particular controller and each controller has several action methods to handle the browser request
  - All controller class must be suffixed with 'Controller' keyword
