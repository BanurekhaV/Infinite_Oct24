DataBase : Can be defined as the storage of inter related data that has been organised in such a manner that process of retrieval of data is effective and efficient

Management System : Set of programs to access the data. An Environment that is both convenient and efficient to use

Purpose of Databases :
Drawbacks of file system
  - Data Redundancy leading to inconsistency
  - Difficulty in accessing data
  - Data Isolation
  - Integrity
  - Concurrency access
  - Security problems
  
DBMS : is built on Data Model 
       Data Model : a collection of tools to describe
                   -Data
                   -Data relationship
                   -Data semantics
                   -Data Constraints


Data Models : 
 - Hierarchical 
 - Network
 - Relational
 - Object Relational (supports media- hypertext, multimedia)

Relational Model : Important terms 
-Relation : a table (collection of well defined specific data strictly organized in a tabular manner
-Tuple : a row in a table 
-Attribute : a column in a table
-Degree : number of attributes in a table
-Cardinality : number of tuples/rows
-Primary Key : a column/set of columns that identifies a unique row/tuple
-Foreign Key :a column in a table that always is dependent on the PK column of another table
-Entity : is anything that exists and is distinguishable
-Entity Set : a group of similar entities (employee -> fulltime/parttime/contract)
-Relationship : an association between entities

Types of Relationships:
 one-one
 one-many
 many-many

SQL : Structured Query Language - a simple English based lang to work with databases. This is not case sensitive
Components of SQL :
1. Data Definition Lang (DDL) : (create, alter, drop, truncate, rename)
2. Data Manipulation Lang(DML) : (Insert, Update, Delete)
3. Data Query Lang (DQL) : (Select)
4. Data Control lang (DCL) : (Grant, Revoke)
5. Transaction Control Lang (TCL) : (Commit, Rollback)

Keys in RDBMS :
 Super Key
 Candidate Keys
 Primary Key
 Alternate keys
 Composite/Compound key
 Unique Key
 Foreign Key

Integrity Constraints : are rules/restrictions enforced on the data column. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database. These are 3 in nos.

 1. Domain Integrity : states that every element from a relation should respect the type and the length restrictions. Also the range of values permitted. (Unique, Check, Default)

 2. Entity Integrity : states that no primary key column has duplicate or null values (Primary Key)

 3. Referential Integrity : states consistency to be maintained among the rows of 2 relations (Foreign Key)

DDL:
Create <object> <object name>

Table creation syntax:
create <object<<object name>(collist <datatype><size> <constraints>)

--adding a column after creation of table

alter table <tablename>
add <columnname><datatype>(size) <constraints> (can give constraints provided there is no data, else cannot)
