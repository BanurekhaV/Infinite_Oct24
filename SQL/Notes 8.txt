Some misc.

isnull() - function used when we want a specific value that needs to be returned if the expression value is null
-can be used in DQL and DML statements

coalesce() - function that evaluates a list of values and returns the first non-null value
 - it is an alternate to isnull() that does not have any restrictions in the no. of arguments like isnull()
 - it is comparable to case statement, but has an advantage over case statement, as it is easier to write and is less code

RollUp : is an extension of the group by clause to calculate sub totals and grand totals for a set of columns

Cube : is similar to rollup, used with group by clause. It can provide sub and grand totals, for all the permutations of the columns set

--addl func
1. row_number() - allocates numbers based on the rows over a particular column
2. rank() - allocates rank over a particular column, but skips the sequence of the  next number, in case there are more rows taking up the same rank
3.dense_rank() - allocates rank over a particular column, without skipping any sequence
