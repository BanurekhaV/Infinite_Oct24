--sorting the output using order by
 - sort by multiple columns
 - sort asc, or desc
 - sort by alias name
 - sort by a column that is not in the select list

--grouping ( on columns whose values repeat)
- dividing the tuples of a relation into sub sets/smaller data sets
- we can apply group by clause on columns that are not in the select list (may not get meaningful results which convey the status)
- we may have to group by on all columns in the select list except the aggregates
- we cannot group by on alias names
