Error Handling : SQL allows simple error handlers with begin try and begin catch blocks
-we can raise and throw specific used defined errors
-All predefined error are below 50000, and all user defined errors are above 50000

Error messages : are brief info describing the error and has a maximum limit of 2047 characters

Severity Level : Tells us the importance of the error
 This ranges between 0 and 24
 0-9 : not severe, considered as status messages/information
 11-16 : Indicates user generated errors
 17-19 : Indicates software errors that cannot be rectified by the users. It has to be reported to sysadmin
 20-24 : Indicate fatal errors that can damage the database/system. The database connection will be terminated immediately to ensure database security

state : it is an arbitrary value not very important to the user. This ranges between 0 and 127

Note : we can throw any errors with an error number >=50000, along with error message and severity level
syntax : throw <errornumber>, <error message>, <severity level>
    throw 50010, 'Some Error occurred', 12

raiserror : raiserror(<errormesg>,<severity>,<errorstate>)

- to add user defined messages to the sysmessages table
 syntax : sp_addmessage <error num>,<error message>,<severity num>
select * from sysmessages 

Transactions : A collection of sql statements that are executed together or not executed at all
 - A database transaction consists of 
    1. DML statements
    2. DDL
    3. DCL
    4. DQL

Begins when the first dml statement is executed and ends with any of the following
   - A commit or a rollback
   - Auto commit
   - User exits
   - System crashes

with commit or rollback statements/commands we can ensure
  - Data Consistency
  - Group logically related operations
  - Preview the data changes before and after
