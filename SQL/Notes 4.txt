Set Commands : are operators that can work with multiple result sets

Rules for using set commands :
 1. The result set of 2 queries must have same number of columns
 2. The datatypes of the columns of both the result set should be same
 3. The positional ordering of the column returned as a result of the query must be same
 4. In case we need sorted output, we can order only the final result

- Union : combines 2 result sets and removes duplicates if any
- Union all : includes duplicates


CTE : Common table Expression
 Are expressions that allow us to define temporary resultset that is available within the execution scope
 We can perform DML operations
 We can have multiple ctes's separated with a ','
 One cte can refer to other cte's
 We can recursive cte's

Advantages : Reusability
             Complex queries can be broken and represented as multiple cte's
             More readable
             Does not occupy memory

Disadvantages : Can be used only within the scope of its declaration and not outside
                not supported by many database platforms
