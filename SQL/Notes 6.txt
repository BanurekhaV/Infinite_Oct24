Functions : are reusable piece of code that is a part of the database schema. Are like procedures
- All functions should return a scalar datatype
- cannot return text, ntext, images, timestamp, cursor etc.
- may or may not take input parameters

Broadly they are of 2 types  :
  1. Scalar
  2. Table Valued : 
      - Inline Table Valued Functions: are functions that return a table(rows, cols)
        - are not enclosed between begin and end statements
        - used in where. join clauses apart from select
        - gives better performance than multi statement valued table functions
      - Multi Statement Table Valued Functions : are functions that can return a structure like table
        - contains begin and end clauses
        - the table like structure can be as per the users requirement

if any given task, can be achieved using inline table valued function, then prefer the same over MSTV functions

Differences between Functions and Stored procesures

- A function must return a scalar value, where as a procedure returns only integer values (if required)
- Functions can have only input parameters, where as procedures can have input, output parameters
- Functions do not support data modifications using dml statements, where as procedures allow data modifications
- Functions cannot support transactions, error handling where as procedures can have transactions and error management
- Functions can call only other functions, where as procedures can call other procedures and functions
- Functions can be used in select, join and where clauses, where as procedures need explicit execute command


Indexes : are mechanisms to sort the physical order of the data in the database

Why indexes ? without indexes, any query/data modifications will cause the SQL engine to search the referenced info in a top- down approach. 

But a single well placed index can shorten the query time from dozens of minutes to less than a second
-Speeds up the data access
-Enforces uniqueness

-They occupy disk space

Indexes are of 3 types : 
1. Clustered Index : 
     -sorts the physical table on every dml operation
     -there can be only one clustered index per table
     -does not need additional space
   clustered index allows duplicate values and unique clustered does not (allows one null)

2. Non Clustered Index :
    -can have many non clustered index per table
    -occupies space in the disk
    -any dml operations does not affect the table, instead only the index table
    -can be either clustered or non-clustered

3. Filtered Index : 
     -is a non clustered index with a predicate
     -used in situations where we need only a portion of the index
    -creates a separate table called as index table with index column and key to the data page


2. Non Clustered Index
