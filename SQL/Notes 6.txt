Functions : are reusable piece of code that is a part of the database schema. Are like procedures
- All functions should return a scalar datatype
- cannot return text, ntext, images, timestamp, cursor etc.
- may or may not take input parameters

  1. Scalar

      - Inline Table Valued Functions: are functions that return a table(rows, cols)
        - are not enclosed between begin and end statements
        - used in where. join clauses apart from select
        - gives better performance than multivalued table functions
      - Multi Statement Table Valued Functions :
