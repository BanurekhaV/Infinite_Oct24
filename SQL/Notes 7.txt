Cursors : are objects that store the result set of any query and allows traversal over the rows

They are of 2 types

-Implicit Cursors : are created by the database engine automatically and processed
-Explicit Cursors : are user defined that can be used for traversal and manipulation

Life Cycle :
  1. Declare a Cursor
  2. Open the Cursor
  3. Fetch the data as long as there are rows
  4. Close the Cursor
  5. Deallocate the Cursor

Cursor Traversal :
1. Forward Only : can move forward only(1st row, 2nd row...)
2. Static Cursor : Cursors that do not reflect any changes made after opening it
3. Dynamic Cursor : Cursors that can reflect changes made after opening it
4. Keyset : They cursors are driven by some unique values
