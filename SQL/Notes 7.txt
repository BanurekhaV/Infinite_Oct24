Cursors : are objects that store the result set of any query and allows traversal over the rows

They are of 2 types

-Implicit Cursors : are created by the database engine automatically and processed
-Explicit Cursors : are user defined that can be used for traversal and manipulation

Life Cycle :
  1. Declare a Cursor
  2. Open the Cursor
  3. Fetch the data as long as there are rows
  4. Close the Cursor
  5. Deallocate the Cursor

Cursor Traversal :
1. Forward Only : can move forward only(1st row, 2nd row...)
2. Static Cursor : Cursors that do not reflect any changes made after opening it
3. Dynamic Cursor : Cursors that can reflect changes made after opening it
4. Keyset : They cursors are driven by some unique values

Cursors Vs While

--Cursors are updatable
--Cursors can move forward and backwards using First, Last, Next, Prior, Relative, Absolute
--Cursors have varied options to behave with regards to locking while updations
--Cursors don't need any condition as a test 
--Global Cursors can be passed to stored procedures

Cons
 --Global Cursors are a risk when faced with cursor errors due to the cursor being closed by some stored procedure
 --Cursors are slower in performance, than a while or CTE's

While Loops :
 --are faster than cursors
 --uses less amounts of locks
 --Less usage of tempdb

Cons 
  --Moving back and forth is not possible
  --Risk of infinite looping

--File Groups : are basically collection of file objects. Primary group is the default group where all data and lof files are stored
Whenever we create a database, sql server creates 2 files
  1. A data File (.mdf)
  2. Transaction Log file (.ldf)

Secondary files .ndf
