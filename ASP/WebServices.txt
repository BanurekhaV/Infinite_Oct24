Evolution of Distributed Application
1. Peer - peer computing : computers over a network share resources without a primary/central server

2. Grid computing : refers to a network of computers that can work together and solve/perform analysis (eg research projects)

3. Cloud computing : Central server, from where the users can access storage, business operations and applications

4. Internet of Things : refers to a network of interconnected devices, such as sensors, appliances

5. Edge computing : involves processing of data closer to the source rather than a central location. Helps in improving performance

Examples of distributed applications
 1. Google Search
 2. Bitcoins
 3. AWS
 4. Open Stack (IAAS)
 5. Smart Grids
