StateManagement : Storing values across various pages using techniques as below:

1. Client Side Technique:
 a) ViewState :  is a simple dictionary object that can store data as key and value pair
  - does not need any typecasting
  - can store any data including UDT
  - It stores at the client side
  - Can retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page
  - Cannot travel to other pages

 b) Hidden Field : is a control of the tool box, that is not visible at the runtime
   - It is a class that needs to be initialized, along with its members. This can be a load on the system
   - Can be used if only few data needs to be stored, else Viewstate is the better option
   - Like ViewState, this also can only retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page, and not other pages
   
 c) Cookies : Allows managing the state across pages
         - can travel to other pages with the previous state

 they are of 2 types

         a) Persistent Cookies : (uses an object of the HttpCookies class to store the data)
         b) Non-Persistent Cookies: (Data is directly stored in the response object)

 d) Query Strings : allows to manage the state across pages using URL
   - we can using Url encoding to format the data
   - The data is sent to other pages via the address bar making it visible
   - Sensitive data should not be sent via query string

2. Server Side Technique :
   a) Session State : are like viewstate that keeps track of state of a page across other pages

  b) Application State : Manages the entire application instance for every session
