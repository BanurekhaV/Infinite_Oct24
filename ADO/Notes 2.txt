XML : Extensible Mark Up Language
 - It is a text based markup lang.
 - It is derived SGML(Standard Generalized Mark Up Lang.)
 - It is a public standard (W3 open standards)
 - XML tags identify the data that are used to store and organize 
 - User defined tags(customization)

Xml Usage : xml simplifies creation of html documents for small and large website/applns
       - it is used to store and exchange data
       - enables customization  of data
       - xml can express any data type

<xml>
<messages>
 <text>
  <Hello>
  <Hi>
 </text>
</message>

&lt - <
&amp - &
&apos -'
&quot -"

xml documents can be created and validated against (well formed)
 1. DTD : Document Type Definition
 2. XSD : Xml schema definition

DTD :
<?xml version="1.0">
<!Doctype Employee System "employee.dtd>
<employees>
 <employee>
  <firstname>ShahRukh</firstname>
  <lastname>Khan</lastname>
 </employee>
<employee>
  <firstname>ShahRukh</firstname>
  <lastname>Khan</lastname>
 </employee>
</employees>

XSD :
<?xml version="1.0">
<Employee
   xmlns="http://www.infinite.com"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema-instance
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.infinite.com employee.xsd>
<firstname>Amitabh </forstname>

</employee>
 
LINQ : Language Integrated Query
 - is a query lang that is a standard to query any data source
 - less code
 - more readable
 - provides intellisense support
 - compile time safe
 - familiar lang (English like)

There are 2 basic ways to write Linq queries
 1. Query Syntax/Expression
       from<range variable> in<IEnumerable>/IQueryable> standard operators<lambda exp>
               select or group by
      
 2. Method Syntax/Methods Extension/Fluent 
     

LINQ to Collections (arrays)
LINQ to Objects
LINQ to Data tables
LINQ to SQL
    

Linq queries can be executed as
   - Immediate : is also known as Greedy Operator
   - Query is executed at the point of declaration/construction
   - Aggregate functions, Element Operators(first,last,single,tolist,toarray, todictionary)

   - Deferred : also known as lazy operator
    - Query is not executed at the point of declaration/construction
    - Is executed when we access the query result 
    - Projection Operators - select, select many
    - Restriction Operators - where
    - Paging operators - take, skip

 -Deferred query avoids unnecessary execution and hence improves performance
 - Query Construction and execution are decoupled
 - A deferred query is re-evaluated whenever we enumerate, hence always getting the latest data
