Indexers : An indexer allows an object to be indexed as an array. The class with an indexer behaves similar to a virtual array. Then we can access the instance of such a class using the array access operator '[]'

- Are similar to properties to some extent. 
- Using get and set accessors, we can get or set values for a particular instance of the object
- Unlike properties, they do not have any names, instead are used with the 'this' keyword
- Indexers can be overloaded by providing different index types
