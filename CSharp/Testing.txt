Software Development Life Cycle : SDLC is a process for developing software.

Development Models:
Waterfall
Prototype
Iteration 
V-Shaped
Spiral 


The various phases involved :
1. Initiation : Begins when a sponsor identifies a need or an opportunity. Concept proposal is created
2. System Concept Development : Defines the scope or boundary of the concepts. Includes system , document, cost benefit analysis, risk analysis, feasibility study etc
3. Planning : Developing Project Management Plan (acquire resources, documents, specify timelines)
4. Requirement Analysis : User needs are analysed. Functional Requirement document
5. Design : Transforming of requirements into system design
6. Development : Designs undergo transformation into IT(Test Driven Development)
7. Integration and Testing : All s/ws are integrated and tested for confirmation to required (quality assurance)
8. Implementation : Preparation of the systems onto the production server
9. Operations and Maintenance : Post Implementation and In-process Reviews
10. Disposition : End of System activities

Testing : Is a process of validating and verifying a software application / product

Unit Testing : Unit is a small piece of code

NUnit : is an open source testing framework under MIT license

Every unit testing will include a well known structure of Triple A's
  - Arrange : Arrange all objects, variables required to test
  - Act : Invoke the methods
  - Assert : checking for correctness of the code

Example :
//arrange
var a = 5;
var b = 5;
var c;

//act 
c = sum(a,b)

//assert
Assert.AreEqual(c,10)
