Covariance : allowing an object of more derived type to be assigned to a lesser derived type

  base class : has some common information
  derived class : will be more derived (base class info + derived class info)

Base b = new Derived(); eg : Shape class object made to point to Rectangle/circle class object

Contravariance : is applied more during argument passing to a function, that creating objects or variables

Delegate Types :

1. Predicate Delegates : is a delegate type that takes one input and returns a Boolean type. Can be with anonymous methods as well as lambda expression

2. Action Delegates : are delegate types may or may not take any input, but does not return any type

3. Function Delegates : are delegate types that are inbuilt. Can take 0 to 16 inputs. Has to return a value. Does not allow 'ref' and 'out' parameters
