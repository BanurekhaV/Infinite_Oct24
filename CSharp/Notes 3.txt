Programming Constructs :
   a) control/selection statements : that controls the path of execution [if else.., switch]

//multiple switch

int d1; string s1; bool b1;
switch((d1,s1,b1))
{
   case(10,"C#",false):
    type out statements
    break;
   case(20,"SQL",true):

}

// switch with return
string result = (d1,s1,b1) switch
{
  (10,"C#",false) => "Best Combo",
  (20,"SQL",true) => "Ultimate",
=> "Default"

};

   b) iteration statements : while do, do while, for, foreach
   c) jump statements : break, continue, goto, return, throw

Iterations : Initial value, Condition, Change of the initial value

Arrays : is a collection of values of the same datatype. It has a fixed size.
Memory for arrays are allocated in the heap
Instantiation of an array is 
   Datatype [] Arrayname = new Datatype[size]  ( int[] arr = new int[5], int[]data= new int[]={3,5,7,8,9})
arr[0] = 7;

There are 3 types of arrays in c#
  Single Dimensional : will have a set of elements
  Two Dimensional/Multi: will have rows and columns
  Jagged Array: smart array (array of arrays)
