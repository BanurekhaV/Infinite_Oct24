Threads : Threads are defined as the execution path of a program
          They are lightweight processes
          Each thread defines a unique flow of control
          The Thread that executes first is the Main Thread
          The Main Thread is automatically created when the program executes, and this in turn can create child threads to perform a particular job.
          The CurrentThread Property of the Thread class is used to access a Thread.
