Object Pooling : is a software development design pattern and a container of list of other objects. Since creating objects is considered to be an expensive process, which can impact the applications performance, pooling objects helps us in these situations

- Objects in the pool have a life cycle of Creation, Validation, and Destroying  

Software Engineering Principles :
1. Separation of concern
2. Modularization
3. Abstractions (what rather than how)
4. Anticipation of Changes :
        -Generality (de-coupled codes)
        -Incremental Development
        -Consistency of Look and Feel
5. DRY : Do Not Repeat Yourselves
6. KISS : Keep it Simple Stupid
7. YAGNI : You Aren't Gonna need it (avoid features and functions that are not required)
8. SOLID : Are Design Principles

 S : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) : a class, structure in the code should always have one job to do

 O : Open Close Principle (OCP) : a s/w module/class is open for extensions, but closed for modifications

 L : Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP) : it is an extension of OCP, where derived classes extending from Base should not change the behaviour of the base class (Usage of Interface Methods)

 I : Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) : Not to force the implementing classes to implement all the methods of the Interface. Instead of fat one fat interface, create many small/thin interfaces with minimum methods

 D : Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) : States that high level modules/classes(consumers/clients) should not depend on low level modules/classes(implementing classes). Both should depend on Abstraction (Layered architecture)

- DIP as a design principle suggests solution to the dependency problem, but does not specify any technique for the same.

- IoC : Inversion of Control : is the actual mechanism to implement DIP

- DI : Dependency Injection : is the design pattern to inject concrete implementation of the low level module components into high level components

Ioc is a Principle and DI is Implementation

DI can be used as below:
  1. Constructor Injection : Instance of the dependency type can be passed as an argument to the constructor of dependent type 
  
 2. Method Injection : Instance of the dependency type can be passed as an argument to the method of a class

 3. Property Injection : Instance of the dependency type can be passed as an argument to the specific property of the dependent type


Based on the SOLID Principles, we have Software Design Patterns
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Design Patterns : are solutions to common problems in software designs. Is a tested document providing solutions for recurring problems in any given context

History and Evolution : Four authors famously knows as Gang of Four, introduced the design pattern concepts in their book 'Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

The GOF categorised the design patterns into 3
1. Creational Pattern : Object creation and initialization without exposing the logic for creation
  
      1: Factory Pattern : Suggests to have a factory where types of object required by the user are created and initialized
   
1.1  Factory Method Design pattern : Provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, but allows the subclasses to alter or decide the type of objects that will be created

      2. Abstract Factory Pattern : As per GOF, this pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of factories with a common theme without specifying their concrete classes(implementing classes)

      components involved
       1. Abstract Factory : declares an interface for operations that create abstract products
       2. Concrete Factory : Implements the operations to create concrete objects
       3. Abstract Product : an interface for a type of product
       4. Concrete Product : that implements the abstract product methods
       5. Client           : uses interfaces declared by abstract factory and product to create a family of products
    
      3. Singleton Pattern : 


2. Structural Pattern : Structural changes of Classes and Interfaces  (Adapter, Bridge, Decorator, proxy)

3. Behavioural Pattern : Relationships between objects and its communication (Iterator, Observer)
