Delegates : are like function pointers that can point to a function/Method
-These are type-safe pointers to a method
-provides a good way to encapsulate methods
-are mainly used to implement callbacks and event programming
-can also be used in anonymous methods invocation
-are reference types

Note : A delegate will point/call a function which matches/agrees with its signature. The class may have static or instance methods

Multicast delegates : is an extension of the normal delegates, where we can make one delegate object point to multiple methods.
-All methods are called in FIFO order.
-we use + or += to add methods to delegate, and - or -= to remove methods
-if the methods that are  multi casted have valid return types, then the delegate would return only value of the last method
-preferred to multicast void return type methods
