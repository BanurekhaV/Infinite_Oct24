Files : Allows the application to persist the data for later use, unlike objects that are volatile

In order to persist data, we have to write and read to and from a source respectively. This is enabled by making use of various in-built classes for persistence
These are available in the System.IO namespace

Serialization : is a process of converting object data into byte stream, so that it can be saved in the memory, files, databases

De Serialization : is a reverse process of serialization, where byte data is converted into object data.

We can do the above in many formats :

1. Binary Serialization
2. XML    ""
3. SOAP   ""  (Simple Object Access protocol)
4. JSON   "" (JavaScript Object Notation) 
 {"Empid" : 100, "EmpName" : "Banurekha","Dept":"IT"}
 

In C# programming, whenever we need to pass some additional info about the data (Meta Data), we pass it as an attribute/Annotation/Metadata
