CSharp : is a modern, general purpose, oo programming language developed by Microsoft
- was developed Anders Hejlsberg and his team during Dotnet framework development

Object Oriented programming : is an architecture for developing an application
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
 
All programming constructs are grouped as class and objects

Namespace : Is a logical way of organizing our program
            Is a collection of Classes, Interfaces, Structures, Enumerators, Events, Delegates and also other namespace
            Provides assistance in avoiding name clashes

Data Types : Those that determine the kind of data we want to use
 - are basically either Value Types and Reference Types
Value Types : All integral/fundamental/primitive/systemic data types Eg :(int,char,float,double,long,byte etc..)
- Are those types that can hold the value/data directly
- Are stored in Stack memory

Reference Types : All objects of classes, interfaces, events and delegates 
- Are those types that holds the reference/address of the memory where data/value is stored
- Stored in Heap memory

Literals in C# :
          string
          integer
          real
          null
          character
          Boolean 

Data Conversions and TypeCasts : Converting one data type to another data type
Implicit conversions : when the compiler can convert from a lower type to a higher type
Explicit conversions : when we as programmers are allowed to convert a higher type to a lower type with a possibility of data loss


int,long,char,byte,sbyte,short etc

float,double,decimal

Operators
Nullables
