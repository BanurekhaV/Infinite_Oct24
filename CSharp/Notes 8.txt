Collections :are specialized classes for data storage and retrieval. 
They can store heterogenous types of data
They are not fixed in size. 
Memory allocations are dynamic
Provide various functionalities for storing, retrieving, manipulating, searching etc..

Common collection classes

1. ArrayList: are collections that can store any data types
2. HashTables: are collections that stores data as a key and value pairs
               - keys cannot be null
               - keys cannot be duplicated
               - keys can be of any data type
               - values can be null or duplicates and any datatype
               - the data in hash table is sorted using a hashing technique, and hence
                   the data will not be either in the inserted order or in a sorted order
3. Sorted List : is similar to that of the Hashtable, except that the collection is in the sorted order of the key.
 
4. Stacks : LIFO
5. Queues : FIFO


Generics : is a way of programming that lets us define type safe classes, methods, properties etc. decoupled with datatypes.
Hence they can provide increased performance and productivity.

Generic Collections :
List
Dictionary
SortedList
Stacks
Queues
